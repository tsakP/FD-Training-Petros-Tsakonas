      Modern-day ouds fall into three categories: Arabian, Turkish, and Persian,
      the last also being known as barbat. This distinction is not based solely
      on geography; the Arabic oud is found not only in the Arabian Peninsula
      but throughout the Arab world. Turkish ouds have been played by Anatolian
      Greeks, where they are called outi, and in other locations in the
      Mediterranean. The Iraqi oud, Egyptian oud and Syrian oud, are normally
      grouped under the term 'Arabian oud' because of their similarities,
      although local differences may occur, notably with the Iraqi oud. However,
      all these categories are very recent, and do not do justice to the variety
      of ouds made in the 19th century, and also today. Arabian ouds are
      normally larger than their Turkish and Persian counterparts, producing a
      fuller, deeper sound, whereas the sound of the Turkish oud is more taut
      and shrill, not least because the Turkish oud is usually (and partly)
      tuned one whole step higher than the Arabian. Turkish ouds tend to be more
      lightly constructed than Arabian with an unfinished sound board, lower
      string action and with string courses placed closer together. Turkish ouds
      also tend to be higher pitched and have a "brighter timbre". Arabian ouds
      have a scale length of between 61 cm and 62 cm in comparison to the 58.5
      cm scale length for Turkish. There exists also a variety of
      electro-acoustic and electric ouds. The modern Persian barbat resembles
      the oud, although differences include a smaller body, longer neck, a
      slightly raised fingerboard, and a sound that is distinct from that of the
      oud. See more information at the page: Barbat (lute). The cümbüş is a
      Turkish instrument that started as a hybrid of the oud and the banjo.
